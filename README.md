# Python Assessment

## Python Test
`/src/python_basics.py` file contains two functions.
1. `square_list`
2. `weighted_sum`

The task is to write implementation of these two functions. Once 
the implementation is done, use pytest to validate if your answers
were correct. Do not modify the any other file in the repo when submitting the result.

## SQL Test
