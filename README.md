# Python Assessment

## Python Test
`/src/python_basics.py` file contains two functions.
1. `square_list`
2. `weighted_sum`

The task is to write implementation of these two functions. Once 
the implementation is done, use pytest to validate if your answers
were correct. 

The instruction for implementation of each function is contained inside the doc string of the same function.

Do not modify the any other file in the repo when submitting the result.

## SQL Test
`/src/sql_basics.py` file contains two functions.
1. `group_by_and_aggregate`
2. `join_dataframes`

The task is to write implementation of these two functions. Once 
the implementation is done, use pytest to validate if your answers
were correct. 

The instruction for implementation of each function is contained inside the doc string of the same function.

Do not modify the any other file in the repo when submitting the result.

## How to get started

The code requires python 3.x.x to run.

1. Clone the repo by running 

`git clone https://github.com/zainulabidin302/python-assessment.git`

from command line or download the zip of the code from the same url.

2. (Optional) Create a `conda` or `virtualenv` and activate it.
3. Install the requirements with 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. For conda users: install dependencies with 

`conda install --yes --file requirements.txt`

5. Implement the solution. Take a closer look at the doc strings for details of implementation.
6. Run `pytest` to verify all the code is running.
7. In root directory, run 

`python src/submit.py <your-email-address>` 

(Notice: Step 7 command will send your solution to our servers for grading and informing HR. Make your tests are passing with pytest before sending your solution. You only have 3 attempts.)
